This section states that whoever causes the death of a person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or with both. However, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death or with the intention of causing death, then it may be considered as culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 299 of the IPC. In such cases, the punishment may extend to imprisonment for life or for a term which may extend to 10 years, along with a fine. Additionally, the driver may also face charges under Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act for driving under the influence of alcohol. This section states that whoever drives a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, to such an extent as to be incapable of exercising proper control over the vehicle, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine or with both'"
